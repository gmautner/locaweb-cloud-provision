# Setup and Deploy Procedures

All setup steps are idempotent -- safe to re-run across agent sessions. Check for existing resources before creating new ones.

## GitHub Repository Setup

Check if a git remote is already configured:

```bash
git remote -v
```

**If no remote is configured**, ask the user:
- Does an existing GitHub repository already exist for this project?
- Or should a new one be created?

**Existing repo**: Ask the user for the URL, then add it:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
```

**New repo**: Create with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo create <repo-name> --private --source=. --remote=origin
# Use --public instead of --private if the user prefers a public repo
```

Verify the remote is configured:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## SSH Key Generation


### Preview environment key

Check if an SSH key already exists for this repo:

```bash
test -f ~/.ssh/<repo-name> && echo "Key exists" || echo "Key missing"
```

If the key does not exist, generate a new Ed25519 SSH key locally:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/<repo-name> -N "" -C "<repo-name>-deploy"
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<repo-name>
```

If the key already exists, reuse it -- do not overwrite.

This key will be:
- Stored as the `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub secret (the private key)
- Used locally to SSH into preview environment VMs for debugging
- The public key is derived automatically by the deploy workflow at runtime

### Additional environment keys

Generate a separate key for each additional environment (Step 8). For example, for the "production" environment:

```bash
test -f ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production && echo "Key exists" || echo "Key missing"
```

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production -N "" -C "<repo-name>-deploy-production"
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production
```

This key will be:
- Stored as a suffixed GitHub secret matching the environment name: e.g., `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION`
- Used locally to SSH into that environment's VMs for debugging
- The caller workflow maps the suffixed secret to the workflow's standard `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` input

## CloudStack Credentials

First check if CloudStack secrets are already set in the repo:

```bash
gh secret list
```

If `CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY` and `CLOUDSTACK_SECRET_KEY` appear in the list, skip this step.

Otherwise, ask the user to set them in a separate terminal. **Never** accept secret values through the chat — they would be stored in conversation history.

Tell the user to run:

```bash
gh secret set CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY
gh secret set CLOUDSTACK_SECRET_KEY
```

(`gh secret set` without `--body` reads the value interactively from stdin, so the secret never appears in command history or chat.)

These credentials are issued by the Locaweb Cloud account administrator.

## Postgres Credentials

Check if the Postgres password secret is already set in the repo:

```bash
gh secret list
```

If `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` already appears, skip this step.

The database user and database name are set by the platform automatically — only the password needs to be configured as a secret.

Generate a random password for **each** environment:

```bash
# Preview password
openssl rand -base64 32

# Production password (different from preview)
openssl rand -base64 32
```

The default preview environment uses unsuffixed names: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

Additional environments use suffixed names matching the environment name:
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_PRODUCTION` for the "production" environment

The caller workflow maps the suffixed secrets to the reusable workflow's standard secret names.

## Creating GitHub Secrets

First list existing secrets to avoid overwriting them:

```bash
gh secret list
gh variable list
```

Only create secrets that are **not already present**.

**Security rule:** Never accept secret values through the chat — they would be stored in conversation history. For secrets the agent knows (generated passwords, local SSH keys), the agent can set them directly. For secrets only the user knows (CloudStack keys, app API keys), ask the user to set them in a separate terminal.

### Secrets the agent can set directly

```bash
# SSH private key for preview (skip if already set)
gh secret set SSH_PRIVATE_KEY < ~/.ssh/<repo-name>

# SSH private key for additional environments, e.g. production (skip if already set)
gh secret set SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION < ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production

# Postgres password for preview (skip if already set)
gh secret set POSTGRES_PASSWORD --body "<generated password>"

# Postgres password for additional environments, e.g. production (skip if already set)
gh secret set POSTGRES_PASSWORD_PRODUCTION --body "<generated password>"
```

### Secrets the user must set via GitHub UI

Get the repository's secrets settings URL:

```bash
echo "$(gh repo view --json url -q .url)/settings/secrets/actions"
```

Give the user the URL and ask them to click **"New repository secret"** for each secret below. For each secret, tell the user:
1. The exact **Name** to enter.
2. Where to find the **Secret** value (e.g., which dashboard, settings page, or credential file to look in).

CloudStack credentials (if not already set):

| Name | Where to find the value |
|------|------------------------|
| `CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY` | [painel-cloud.locaweb.com.br](https://painel-cloud.locaweb.com.br/) → Contas → *(sua conta)* → Visualizar usuários → *(seu usuário)* → Copiar Chave da API |
| `CLOUDSTACK_SECRET_KEY` | Same page → Copiar Chave secreta |

App-specific secrets — store each one **individually**. **Never** store `SECRET_ENV_VARS` as a single monolithic secret:

| Name | Where to find the value |
|------|------------------------|
| `API_KEY` | *(describe where the user can find this value)* |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | *(describe where the user can find this value)* |

Then compose them in the caller workflow's `SECRET_ENV_VARS` block:

```yaml
secrets:
  SECRET_ENV_VARS: |-
    API_KEY=${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    SMTP_PASSWORD=${{ secrets.SMTP_PASSWORD }}
```

This way, updating a single secret only requires creating/updating it in the GitHub UI — no need to remember or rewrite the others.

### Clear (non-secret) env vars

```bash
gh variable set ENV_VARS --body "APP_ENV=preview
LOG_LEVEL=debug"
```

Verify all secrets are set:

```bash
gh secret list
gh variable list
```

## Deploy Cycle

After committing workflows and pushing:

### 1. Monitor the workflow run

```bash
# Watch the latest run
gh run watch

# Or list runs and watch a specific one
gh run list --limit=5
gh run watch <run-id>
```

Give the user a direct link to the job in the GitHub UI:

```bash
echo "$(gh repo view --json url -q .url)/actions/runs/<run-id>/job/$(gh run view <run-id> --json jobs -q '.jobs[0].databaseId')"
```

### 2. If the workflow fails

Read the error:

```bash
# View the failed run's logs
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Common failure causes:
- **Missing secrets**: `gh secret list` to verify all required secrets exist
- **Dockerfile issues**: Build failures, wrong port, missing health check
- **Permission errors**: Ensure `permissions: contents: read, packages: write` in the caller workflow
- **Input errors**: Invalid zone, plan name, or type mismatches

Fix the issue, commit, and push. The preview workflow (triggered on push) will start a new run automatically.

### 3. Repeat until successful

Continue the cycle: read error -> fix -> commit/push -> watch run. Do not give up after one failure -- iterate.

### 4. On success, extract deployment info

```bash
# Get the web IP from the latest successful run
gh run view <run-id>

# Or download the provision-output artifact (clean first to avoid stale data)
rm -rf /tmp/provision-output
gh run download <run-id> --name provision-output --dir /tmp/provision-output
cat /tmp/provision-output/provision-output.json
```

The app URL is `https://<web_ip>.nip.io` (for preview without a domain).

## App Verification Cycle

After the workflow succeeds, verify the application is working:

### 1. Browse the app

Open `https://<web_ip>.nip.io` in a browser or fetch with curl:

```bash
# Health check
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://<web_ip>.nip.io/up

# Home page
curl -s https://<web_ip>.nip.io/
```

For browser-based verification, use Playwright:

```bash
# Install (one-time, cached for future runs)
npm install playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

Then use Playwright to navigate pages, take screenshots, fill forms, and verify the app behaves correctly in a real browser.

### 2. If the app doesn't respond or behaves incorrectly

SSH into the VMs to debug. Use the SSH key generated earlier and the public IPs from the workflow output.

See [SSH Debugging](#ssh-debugging) below for detailed commands.

### 3. Fix and redeploy

Fix the source code, commit, push. The preview workflow runs automatically. Watch the run, then verify the app again.

### 4. Repeat until the app works

Continue the cycle: browse -> SSH debug -> fix source -> commit/push -> deploy -> browse.

## SSH Debugging

Use the locally saved SSH key and the public IPs from the workflow output to connect to VMs. Use the correct key for the environment: `~/.ssh/<repo-name>` for preview, `~/.ssh/<repo-name>-<env_name>` for other environments.

```bash
# Preview
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<repo-name> root@<web_ip>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<repo-name> root@<db_ip>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<repo-name> root@<worker_ip>

# Production (or other environment — use the corresponding key)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production root@<web_ip>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production root@<db_ip>
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<repo-name>-production root@<worker_ip>
```

### Useful debug commands on the VMs

```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# View web app logs
docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter "label=service=<repo-name>") --tail 100

# Follow logs in real time
docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter "label=service=<repo-name>") -f

# Check if the app responds locally on port 80
curl -s localhost:80/up

# View kamal-proxy logs (web VM only)
docker logs kamal-proxy --tail 50

# Check Postgres container logs (database VM only)
docker logs <repo-name>-db --tail 100

# Check disk mounts
df -h /data/blobs    # web VM
df -h /data/db       # database VM

# Check container environment variables
docker exec $(docker ps -q --filter "label=service=<repo-name>") env
```
